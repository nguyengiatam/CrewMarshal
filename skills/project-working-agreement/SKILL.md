description: Use before executing or dispatching work on a project, and whenever the user changes how the work should run — keeps one project file of working rules (stop after each task or continue, parallel or sequential executors by default, one coordinator or several lanes once the project qualifies, what coordinator/executor/reviewer may decide, plan detail, commit and language conventions), set up once by asking the user and reused by every later session and every executor.

# Project Working Agreement

The system profile says **what the system is**. The working agreement says **how
we work on it**: when to stop, who decides what, what each role may and may not
do. Without it, every session re-guesses — one stops after every task, the next
runs through the whole plan — and executors never hear the rules at all.

## The File

Default location `docs/superpowers/working-agreement.md`, next to
`system-profile.md`. Template:
[references/working-agreement-template.md](references/working-agreement-template.md).

**Look before you create.** If the project already keeps working rules in
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or a similar file, integrate with that — add the missing
groups there, or keep them here and point from there. One place holds each rule;
never two copies that can drift.

Markers as in the profile: `✓` = the user settled it, `~` = proposed or inferred,
not yet confirmed, `CHƯA CHỐT` = open. Only `✓` lines bind. A `~` line is a
question you still owe the user.

## Reading It — before executing or dispatching

1. Read it before the first task you execute or hand off in a session.
2. **Re-read when it may have changed:** the file was edited, the user stated a new
   rule, or context was compacted. A rule changed mid-session applies from the
   **next relevant step** — never keep the old one because you read it first.
3. Apply the cadence and the role limits to what you are about to do.

## Setting It Up — missing file or missing groups

1. Search for existing rules first (above). Don't ask what the project or this
   session has already settled.
2. Ask what is missing **in one batched message**, grouped. Draft `~` answers where
   the repo shows precedent; ask the rest outright.
3. Write the answers to the file as `✓`, commit per the project's commit rules.
   Anything the user can't decide yet stays `CHƯA CHỐT`.

### The cadence question is always asked explicitly

Offer at least these two, and never pick for the user — not even from an example
they gave:

1. **Stop after each task** — finish and verify the task, report, wait for the user
   before the next one.
2. **Continue** — keep going within the agreed scope; ask only when a decision or
   permission is missing. When one part is blocked, continue the independent rest.

Pin down what "a task" means in this project's workflow (a plan task, a phase, a
PR). One tool call is not a task. Continuing never means widening scope or
skipping verification.

### The execution-mode question is always asked explicitly too

Cadence says *when to stop*; execution mode says *how many executors run at once*.
Left unasked, a session defaults to one task at a time — it is the easiest plan to
write, not a choice anyone made — and a project that has several executors never
uses them. Offer at least these two, and never pick for the user:

1. **Prefer parallel** — plans are designed for several executors at once: draw the
   dependency graph, split shape-only edges into a contract task, fill each wave as
   wide as the team, quota, and review capacity allow. Sequential is the exception,
   and every wave of one task says why (what the tasks collide on, or what behaviour
   the next task needs).
2. **Prefer sequential** — one task in flight at a time. Parallel only when the user
   asks for it on a specific plan. Right when review capacity is the bottleneck, the
   area is fragile, or the team is effectively one agent.

Also settle, if the user has a view: the widest wave they want (e.g. "tối đa 3
executor cùng lúc"). The mode shapes plans at design time — `planning-for-delegation`
reads it when it draws the waves; `orchestrating-executors` runs what the plan drew.
It is not a dispatch-time override: a plan written sequentially does not become
parallel at dispatch, and a parallel plan still respects the wave limits.

### The coordination-mode question is asked only when it applies

Execution mode says how many *executors* run at once; coordination mode says how
many *coordinators* do. Unlike the two questions above, this one is **not asked by
default** — a small project never sees it and runs as it always has:

1. **Single** *(what an unanswered project runs)* — one coordinator, the arc as
   `using-crewmarshal` draws it. No lanes, no extra files.
2. **Multi-lane** — a Chief keeps design, contracts, integration and the only
   conversation with the user; lane coordinators, each owning one service or one
   large independent area, run headless under it. See `multi-lane-coordination`.

Ask it when design or planning finds **at least two areas that qualify as lanes**
(the lane test in `multi-lane-coordination`) — `concept-briefing` when it profiles
the system, or `planning-for-delegation` when it draws the waves. Offer both, never
pick for the user. If they choose multi-lane, also settle the lane-run limits:
roughly how many accepted tasks one lane run may take, and how large its context
may grow, before it looks for a clean stop; and the hard turn ceiling as a safety net.

## The Groups

| Group | What to settle |
|-------|----------------|
| Cadence | Stop after each task, or continue within scope; what "a task" is |
| Execution mode | Prefer parallel or sequential executors; widest wave, if the user sets one |
| Coordination mode | Single or multi-lane — only once two areas qualify as lanes; lane-run limits if multi-lane |
| Coordinator | Design, breakdown, dispatch, dependency calls, acceptance, keeping state |
| Executor | What it may decide alone, what it must verify, what its report contains |
| Reviewer | Scope, evidence a finding needs, fix directions, what happens on disagreement |
| Authority | What anyone decides alone, what needs the user, what to do when blocked |
| Project rules | Plan detail, language, commit/PR, environment, progress reporting, anything else |

These are the questions to ask, not a fixed role set to impose. Roles can merge
(one agent coordinating and reviewing) — but the plugin's verification boundaries
still hold: whoever writes the code does not certify it, and findings are
re-verified on real source.

**Plan detail** lives here, in *Project rules* — `planning-for-delegation` asks it
the first time a plan is written and records it here, not upfront.

## Changing It

- A request the user makes now applies **within what it covers**. It becomes a
  lasting rule only if that is what the user means — when unclear, ask one line:
  "ghi thành quy ước lâu dài không?"
- An edit to a `✓` line needs the user. A line you revise from new evidence drops
  back to `~` until confirmed.
- The agreement never overrides instructions of higher priority — the harness, the
  user's direct instruction in this session.

## Passing It On

Executors and reviewers don't read your session. The part of the agreement that
applies to their role reaches them through the executor context file (see
`executor-context`) or the handoff prompt — for agents outside your harness too.
That you read the agreement proves nothing about whether they did.

## What Doesn't Go In

| Content | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Scale, trade-off priorities, hard system boundaries | `system-profile.md` (`concept-briefing`) |
| Execution detail every executor needs (scope dirs, test commands) | Executor context file (`executor-context`), which points here for role rules |
| Where the work stands | Pointer (`pointer-handoff`) |
| Lessons from past mistakes | `lessons-ledger` |

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "They said 'keep going' once, so the cadence is continuous" | An example is not a rule. Ask the cadence question explicitly. |
| "Sequential is simpler, I'll plan one task at a time" | That is a choice the user makes, once. Ask the execution-mode question. |
| "Mode is parallel, but these are easier in a row" | In parallel mode a one-task wave needs a stated reason. "Easier" is not one. |
| "I read the agreement at the start, that's enough" | It may have changed. Re-read after edits, new user rules, or compaction. |
| "Continuous mode, so I'll take the next phase too" | Continue within the agreed scope only. Continuing never widens it. |
| "The user asked for X this time — write it into the agreement" | Only if they meant it to last. Ask one line. |
| "I'll copy the rules into the executor context too" | Point at them. Two copies drift. |
| "The coordinator read it, so the executor knows" | Executors don't see your session. Pass the role's part on. |
| "No agreement yet — I'll assume sensible defaults" | Defaults nobody chose are how sessions disagree. Ask, batched, once. |
