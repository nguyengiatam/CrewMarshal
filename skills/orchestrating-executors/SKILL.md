# Orchestrating External Executors

You are the architect and reviewer. External coding agents (the "executors")
implement the plan one task at a time; you gate every task before the next begins.

This covers executors that are **separate tools with their own quotas, quirks, and
failure modes** — as opposed to subagents inside your own harness (on Claude Code,
`superpowers:subagent-driven-development` covers those). See *Knowing Your
Workforce* below for choosing between the two. Exact invocations live in
[references/executor-roster.md](references/executor-roster.md) — read it before
dispatching. Keep this skill's body agent-agnostic; all machine-specific commands
stay in the roster.

## Roles

Four roles. One agent may hold several — with one exception that is never
negotiable.

| Role | Does | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Coordinator** (you) | Splits work, dispatches, monitors, verifies, decides | Never delegate this |
| **Plan author** | Turns a short spec into a task-by-task plan with real code | Often worth delegating: plans are long to write and cheap to review |
| **Executor** | Implements exactly one task, then stops | May be several in parallel |
| **Adversarial reviewer** | Stress-tests the result — see `adversarial-review-to-go` | Prefer a different agent than the one that wrote the code |

**The non-negotiable: whoever writes the code does not get to certify it.** An
executor that writes both the function and its tests has proven only that the code
matches itself. When accepting such work, compute the expected numbers yourself
from the fixtures and check the output against *those* — not against the
executor's assertions. This is what makes it safe to delegate even business
logic: the rigor moves to verification instead of staying in authorship.

You may write code yourself for foundation, concurrency-critical, or verification
code where precision beats delegation. Also for **purely mechanical work already
spelled out in the plan** — arguing with a weak executor costs more than typing it.

## Selecting an Executor

**Check quota across the whole roster before assigning heavy work**, not just for
the one you intend to use — you need to know your fallbacks before you need them.

Then match work to agent:

| Work | Route to |
|------|----------|
| Writing detailed plans from a spec | The strongest reasoning agent available; you review rather than write |
| Business logic, algorithms, anything with a subtle contract | A capable executor **plus** independent verification of the numbers |
| Mechanical: scaffolding, copying modules, CRUD, enum plumbing | The cheapest agent with quota — or yourself if it's fully specified |
| Review of concurrency, migration, crash-gap | The review-strong agent, and never the one that wrote the code |

Start from the plan's assignment table (`planning-for-delegation`): it names who does
each task and which tasks share a wave, picked from the project's team file (see
below). At dispatch you only confirm it still holds — quota, and nothing new in the
team file against that agent. A swap stays within the source of labor the user
approved and gets written back into the table and the pointer.

Reserve quota on at least one agent as a fallback and second opinion. Running
every agent to zero leaves you unable to review what the last one produced.

## Knowing Your Workforce

Coordinating is a management job: you are expected to know who is available, what
each one is for, and what each has actually proven. Two distinct sources of labor:

| | **Subagent** (inside your own harness) | **External agent** (its own CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| Quota | Spends the **current session's** budget | Its own, independent budget |
| Start-up | Warm — inherits framing you provide cheaply | Cold — knows nothing, needs the context file |
| Observability | Tracked by your harness | Needs its own monitor; can die silently |
| Independence | Same model family, correlated blind spots | Genuinely different eyes |
| Best for | Work needing deep context; when external agents are out of quota | Preserving session budget; independent review |

**Which source to use is the user's call, not yours.** The two spend different
budgets — one burns the session the user is paying for right now, the other burns
a CLI quota that may be reserved for something else. Picking silently spends
resources on their behalf.

### First time a project needs a subagent — confirm

If the project has **no history of using subagents** (no team file, or no subagent
entry in it) and the work calls for one, **stop and ask** before dispatching:

- Subagent inside this session, or an external agent?
- If a subagent: which kind/model?
- What role — writing code, reviewing, or investigating?

Then **record the answer in the team file** so this is asked once, not every time.
When the team file already answers it, follow it silently; only come back to the
user when the situation falls outside what's recorded (a new role, or the recorded
choice is out of quota).

### The team file

`docs/team.md` in the project — assignments belong to the project
(this project writes code with one model, the next may not), while
[the roster](references/executor-roster.md) holds what exists on this machine and
how to invoke it. Different lifetimes, different files.

```

**Record both wins and failures, each with evidence.** "Handled the aggregation
engine, 11 tasks, 491 tests green" and "went silent 15 minutes holding a pipe on a
DB script" are both assignments-relevant. Judgments without evidence decay into
prejudice, and you will either over-trust an agent that got lucky once or refuse
one that failed for a reason you've since fixed.

Update it when a phase ends, and whenever an agent surprises you in either
direction. An assignment table nobody maintains sends the next phase's work to
whoever happened to be listed first.

## Quota Management

Quota is a resource you allocate across a phase, not a thing you check once.

- **Silent exhaustion is the classic trap.** An agent out of quota often runs,
  prints a line of preamble, exits 0 with near-empty output — indistinguishable
  from "ran but did nothing" until you look for the work it didn't do. The roster
  documents each agent's quota-check command; run it rather than inferring from
  behavior.
- **Check before dispatching heavy or parallel work**, and re-check after a
  suspiciously fast or empty result.
- **Know the reset windows.** An agent that resets in a few hours is worth waiting
  for; one on a weekly window must be spent deliberately.
- **Budget by role.** Reviews are token-heavy and repeat over rounds; a converging
  review loop can cost more than the implementation did. Don't spend the reviewer's
  quota on implementation you could route elsewhere.
- When an agent goes quiet mid-task, **check quota before debugging the task** —
  it's the cheaper hypothesis.

## Dispatching One Task

A **checkpoint** is the reviewable unit: **one plan task → one commit on a feature
branch → executor stops → you review.** Enforce all of:

1. One task per handoff. The prompt names the single task, the current HEAD, the
   baseline test state, and this repo's safety rules.
2. The executor commits its own work (or stops without committing, if that's your
   convention) and halts.
3. You review before releasing the next task: `checkpoint-verification`, then
   `convention-commit-gate`, on the actual diff — never on the executor's summary.
4. Verification output is real and pasted. "Tests pass" without the run output is
   not acceptance.

If an executor violated the protocol (ran ahead, skipped verification, edited
another repo), stop and reconcile before continuing — do not paper over it.

### Handoff prompt checklist

- The single task and its acceptance criteria, copied from the plan.
- Current HEAD SHA and the baseline test count/state.
- **A pointer to the executor context file** (see `executor-context`) instead of
  restating project conventions, scope boundaries, test rules, and reporting
  requirements every time. If something is missing there, fix the file rather
  than growing the prompt.
- Any lesson specific to the area this task touches, as one constraint line —
  check `lessons-ledger` by area and work type.
- The instruction to reconcile against real code/enums before hardcoding anything.
  **When an executor stops to question the plan, take it seriously** — that is
  usually a hole in your handoff, not a defect in the executor.
- Safety rules for this dispatch: branch, port/DB isolation if parallel, which
  files another executor is currently holding.

## Dispatching Asynchronously

**Every dispatch to an external executor runs in the background with a monitor
attached at the moment of launch — and then you go do something else.** The
monitor waits and reports; you decide, verify, and accept. Waiting is the
monitor's job, not yours.

### A dispatch is complete only with evidence of all three

1. **The executor actually started** — the signal the roster lists for that agent
   (a session file, a running job, a first log line). A launched command is not a
   started executor.
2. **The monitor is running** and its notification comes back **to this session,
   for this run** — not "I'll keep an eye on it", not a PID written down.
3. **The run is recorded:** task, executor, run id, BASE commit, where the result
   and log will be. Write it to the pointer now (see `pointer-handoff`) — the
   session may end before the result arrives.

Until all three hold, the task is *dispatched*, not *running*. Say which.

### How to attach the monitor, in order of preference

1. **Harness-tracked background work that notifies you on exit.** Often the launch
   itself can run this way, so the executor exiting *is* the notification.
2. **A watcher script run as harness-tracked background work**, exiting when a
   concrete condition is met: a new commit past BASE, the executor process gone,
   or silence past a threshold. The script may check on a timer internally — the
   point is that *you* are not woken on every cycle.
3. **Neither is available** → the dispatch does **not** meet the async contract.
   Say so plainly. Use the fallback the project has already allowed, or ask the
   user; do not slide silently into checking every turn.

Before relaunching after a monitor failure, confirm the executor is not already
running. A broken monitor on a live executor is two facts — record both; a second
launch on top of it is a duplicate dispatch.

### After dispatch: work or wait, never poll

- **Carry on with independent work** inside the scope and cadence the working
  agreement (`project-working-agreement`) allows. If there is none, end the turn and wait for the notification.
- **Do not read logs, check the PID, or ask the executor on a schedule just to
  learn "is it done yet".** Check by hand only when a signal looks wrong, when you
  suspect the monitor has died, or when the user asks for progress.
- Async is not a licence: it does not permit dispatching further tasks or running
  in parallel beyond what was agreed, and a stop-after-each-task rhythm still
  stops after acceptance.

### When a notification arrives

- **Match it to the task and run.** Drop duplicates and events from an older run;
  a repeated notice must never cause a second acceptance or a second dispatch of
  the next task.
- **Exit code 0, a new commit, changed files are progress — not acceptance.** Move
  the task to awaiting acceptance and run `checkpoint-verification`.
- **Silence past the threshold is a warning to investigate, not a verdict.** It can
  be an agent working, out of quota, or a process holding a pipe waiting for input
  that never comes. Distinguish by evidence: process state, quota, log timestamps,
  changed files. A live process proves nothing about completion; an exited one
  proves nothing about success.

### Task states

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Dispatched | Launch issued; not yet evidence that the executor started and the monitor is attached |
| Running | Executor started, monitor attached, run recorded |
| Awaiting acceptance | Executor returned; you have not verified it |
| Done | You verified it and every applicable gate passed |
| Blocked | Missing a decision, information, or precondition |
| Failed | Evidence the run did not meet the task; decide fix or re-dispatch (as a new run) |
| Cancelled | Confirmed stopped, within your authority |

**Only Done is done.** Nothing else counts as a completed task — in the pointer or anywhere else.

### Rules paid for in lost time

1. **Capture the BASE commit at dispatch and give it to the monitor.** Without a
   baseline, "a new commit appeared" is unanswerable and an old commit looks like
   progress.
2. **Never describe a monitor you did not actually start.** A described-but-unstarted
   monitor once cost half an hour of a dead dispatch — everything *looked* fine
   because nothing was watching.
3. **Never poll to fill the silence.** Every status check spends your context on a
   question the monitor already answers.

## Running Executors in Parallel

Parallel dispatch is where throughput comes from, and where the coordinator's
mistakes get multiplied.

- **Run the waves the plan drew** — which tasks run together was settled in the
  assignment table, not improvised at dispatch. If the agreement says *prefer
  parallel* and the plan runs everything one at a time with no reasons given, send
  the plan back through `planning-for-delegation` before dispatching — don't
  quietly run it as a queue, and don't widen it on the fly either.
- **Partition by file, and say so explicitly in every prompt** — list the files
  each other executor is holding, with "do not touch, not even to fix an error."
- **Isolate shared resources**: ports, databases, fixture directories. Two
  executors sharing a test database will produce failures that belong to neither.
- **Warn that repo-wide lint/typecheck will show foreign errors.** Tell them to
  scope their own check to their files and to report which errors came from
  outside their scope — otherwise they will "helpfully" fix someone else's file
  and destroy the isolation.
- **Keep the checkpoint discipline per executor.** Parallel dispatch means several
  one-task handoffs at once, not one executor running several tasks.
- **Two tasks may share a contract only when it was laid down and reviewed first**
  and is read-only for both (`planning-for-delegation`). Say so in each prompt: the
  contract files, and "if it is wrong, stop and report — do not edit it". A
  contract still being shaped belongs to one task; the others wait.

## The Loop

```
read working agreement → cadence + execution mode + role limits (set it up if missing)
read team.md → who is assigned what here; ask the user if a role is unfilled
read the plan's assignment table → waves, assignees, what each task holds
  (no plan file, e.g. T1 → one task, one wave; pick the assignee from team.md)
for each wave:
  for each task in the wave:
    check quota → confirm the assignee (swap within the approved source; record it)
    capture BASE commit
    dispatch ONE task in the background (prompt → context file + task + area lessons
      + files the rest of the wave holds)
    attach monitor immediately (exit: new commit / process gone / silence) → record run in pointer
  do independent work, or end the turn and wait for notifications — never poll
  per notification → match task + run → awaiting acceptance
    checkpoint-verification   (call-site + real runtime path; recompute expected numbers yourself)
    convention-commit-gate    (enums, no magic literals, commit style)
    fix or re-dispatch if a gate fails
    record any lesson learned  → lessons-ledger
    update team.md if an agent surprised you either way
  next wave only when every task in this one is Done
when a risky area is complete, before merge:
    adversarial-review-to-go  (converge findings to GO)
then:
    finish/merge the branch (superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch on Claude Code)
```

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The executor said tests pass, ship it" | Run `checkpoint-verification` yourself. Summaries hide skipped links. |
| "Its tests are green, the logic is right" | It wrote both. Recompute the expected values from fixtures and check against those. |
| "Let it do the next task too, this one looks fine" | One task per checkpoint. Unreviewed work compounds. |
| "I'll just assign it, quota is probably fine" | Check first. Silent quota failure looks exactly like "did nothing". |
| "Everything else is out of quota — I'll spin up a subagent" | That spends the user's current session instead. If the project has no subagent history, ask which kind and for what role. |
| "The user won't care which agent does this" | They pay for it, in different budgets. Silent substitution spends their resources for them. |
| "I remember this agent is bad at that" | Check the team file. If the memory isn't recorded with evidence, it's prejudice — and the reason it failed may already be fixed. |
| "I'll check on it in a while" | Attach a monitor at dispatch, with a real exit condition and a BASE commit. |
| "I've got a watcher on it" (but didn't start one) | Say "no monitor — dispatch doesn't meet the async contract." A described-but-unstarted watch costs you the whole idle period. |
| "Let me peek at the log, see if it's done" | The monitor will tell you. Check by hand only on a wrong-looking signal, a suspected dead monitor, or a user request. |
| "Nothing else to do, I'll check every minute" | End the turn and wait for the notification. |
| "Exit 0 and a new commit — mark it done" | That's progress. It's awaiting acceptance until `checkpoint-verification` passes. |
| "Monitor failed, relaunch the whole thing" | Check whether the executor is already running first. Two launches = a duplicate dispatch. |
| "It's been quiet, it must be working" | Silence is ambiguous. Check quota, process state, and whether any file changed. |
| "Process is still alive, so it's still working" | Liveness proves nothing. Check the data it should have produced. |
| "This tiny mechanical change — delegate it" | If it's fully specified, you're faster than the round-trip. |
| "The executor is wrong, override it" | When an executor stops to question the plan, it's often right. Verify against source before dismissing. |
| "It hit the same trap as last phase" | The lesson never reached it. Promote it into the executor context file — you are the constant in that pattern. |
| "I'll restate the conventions in this prompt" | Point at the context file and fix the file. Retyped conventions drift and get omitted under pressure. |
