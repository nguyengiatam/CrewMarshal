# Multi-Lane Coordination

One coordinator runs out of room on a project with many services: every task's
review, every executor's report and every open question pile into one context.
Multi-lane splits the **execution** across several coordinators while keeping one
place that designs, integrates and talks to the user.

This runs only when the working agreement says `Chế độ điều phối: nhiều lane` ✓
(`project-working-agreement`). Without that line the project is single-coordinator
and nothing here applies — small projects keep the arc exactly as it is.

## Roles

| Role | Does | Never does |
|------|------|------------|
| **Chief** (the user's session) | Design, system profile, working agreement, team file, cross-service spec and contracts, splitting lanes, launching lane runs, answering lane questions (asking the user when needed), integration | Re-review a lane's individual tasks; edit a lane's files |
| **Lane coordinator** (headless, one per lane) | Plans, dispatches and accepts the tasks of one lane, inside its charter, with the normal arc (`planning-for-delegation`, `orchestrating-executors`, `checkpoint-verification`) | Talk to the user; edit outside its owned paths; edit commons |
| **Executor** | One task, as today | — |

**The user talks to the Chief only.** A lane that needs a decision stops its run
and asks the Chief in writing; the Chief batches questions to the user and writes
the answers back. It costs more tokens than letting lanes ask directly — the price
of the user dealing with one agent.

## The Lane Test

An area becomes a lane only if **all** of these hold:

- **Own repo or own directory** it alone writes — a service, or a feature folder
  large enough to matter.
- **Own tests and build** that run without the other lanes' code changing.
- **No file written by two lanes.** Anything two lanes would both touch is
  *commons* (below), not part of either lane.
- **Enough work to pay for a coordinator** — at least two waves in its plan.
  Smaller areas merge into a neighbouring lane or stay with the Chief.

Fewer than two areas pass → stay single. The coordination-mode question is not
even asked.

## Who Owns What

Everything project-wide stays with the Chief; a lane gets a thin layer in its
charter. **One writer per file** — that rule is what lets several sessions run at
once without overwriting each other.

| Resource | Project tier — Chief writes | Lane tier — in the charter |
|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `system-profile.md` | Scale, trade-offs, hard boundaries | Only what differs for this service |
| `working-agreement.md` | Cadence, modes, conventions | May **tighten** (e.g. adversarial review on every task), never loosen |
| `team.md` | Every agent and its proven record | The lane's executor pool — a subset the Chief assigns |
| Executor context | Project-wide conventions | Scope dirs, test and build commands of this service |
| Roadmap, cross-service spec, contracts | Written and frozen before lanes open | Which contracts the lane provides and consumes |
| Plan | — | The lane coordinator writes its own, inside the charter |
| `lessons-ledger` | One shared ledger | Lanes **propose** lessons in their outbox; the Chief records them |

**Commons** — lockfiles, root manifests, CI config, compose files, migration
numbering, shared libraries, contract files and all of `docs/superpowers/` — belong
to the Chief. A lane that needs a change there asks for it.

**Contracts are frozen while lanes run**, the same rule `planning-for-delegation`
applies to a wave, one level up. A lane that finds a contract wrong stops and asks;
the Chief amends it where the project keeps contracts, then tells every lane that
consumes it.

## Layout

A project may be one repo or a workspace of several (a folder holding an API repo,
a web repo, a docs repo…). Everything below is anchored to the **project root**:
the directory that holds the shared documents, `docs/superpowers/`, and where the
Chief's session runs.

| Project shape | Project root |
|---------------|--------------|
| One repo | The repo's root |
| Workspace of repos | Wherever the project already keeps `docs/superpowers/` — the workspace folder, or a docs repo inside it. Never two. |

- **Coordination state:** `<project-root>/.crewmarshal/`. Not versioned, no history.
  If the project root is itself a git repo, the Chief adds `.crewmarshal/` to its
  `.gitignore` once, when opening the first lane.
- **Code:** a lane writes in one repo or several. For each, it gets a git worktree
  on branch `lane/<name>`, cut from that repo's `main`, at
  `<project-root>/.crewmarshal/worktrees/<name>/<repo>/` — one ignored place for
  all of it.
- **Shared documents** stay at `<project-root>/docs/superpowers/`. Lanes read them
  there by absolute path, whichever repo they work in.

```
<project-root>/.crewmarshal/
├── lanes/<name>/
│   ├── charter.md    ← Chief writes: repos and paths, contracts, pool, what shared docs to read
│   ├── STATUS.md     ← lane writes: the lane pointer (pointer-handoff format)
│   ├── inbox.md      ← Chief writes: numbered entries — assignments, answers, contract changes, "tìm điểm dừng"
│   ├── outbox.md     ← lane writes: numbered entries — ready @sha, questions, escalations, lesson proposals, reset
│   ├── jobs/         ← lane's detached executor jobs: <id>.log, <id>.exit
│   └── runs/         ← one output file per lane run, written by the Chief's launch
└── worktrees/<name>/<repo>/
```

Templates: [references/lane-files.md](references/lane-files.md).

The Chief launches every lane run with two environment variables,
`CREWMARSHAL_PROJECT_ROOT` and `CREWMARSHAL_LANE`. They tell the run — and the
plugin's hooks — where the project root is and which lane this session is,
whatever repo or directory it was started in.

The Chief's own pointer stays the project pointer (`docs/superpowers/STATUS.md`)
and carries a **lane board** — see `pointer-handoff`.

## Opening a Lane

After the shared design is done — profile, agreement, team, cross-service spec,
frozen contracts — the Chief, per lane:

1. Creates a worktree and branch in every repo the lane writes.
2. Writes the charter: the project root, repos and worktree paths, owned paths, read-only paths, contracts provided and
   consumed, executor pool, any tightened rules, **which shared documents (and
   which sections) the lane must read** — a lane never loads everything.
3. Writes inbox entry #1: the first milestone.
4. Adds the lane to the lane board, then launches its first run.

## A Lane Run

Every run is a **new headless session**. The Chief never resumes one: a resumed
session drags its whole history back into context, which is what the reset exists
to shed. The charter, the lane pointer and the inbox are the only memory a run has.

**Start:**
1. In each of its worktrees, merge that repo's `main` into `lane/<name>`. This
   brings in what the Chief and other lanes landed there. It cannot conflict when
   every lane stays inside its owned paths — a conflict means a boundary was
   crossed: write an escalation and stop.
2. Read the charter, then the shared documents and contracts it names, from the
   project root.
3. Read the lane pointer and reconcile it with `git log` of its branches
   (`pointer-handoff`). A run that hit the hard ceiling last time left it stale.
4. Read the inbox from the entry after the last one the pointer acknowledges.

**Working:** the normal arc, inside the charter. After **every accepted task**,
re-read the inbox — it is the only way the Chief reaches a running lane.

**Executors inside a lane run** are launched **detached**, each writing its exit
code to `jobs/<id>.exit` when it ends. A headless session kills its own background
tasks when it exits (verified on Claude Code 2.1.282: `run_in_background` work died
with the session, a `nohup … &` process survived). So a lane run never waits on an
executor: it dispatches, records every job in its pointer's *Đang dở*, and stops.
The Chief watches the exit files and starts the next run when they land. Exact
commands are in the roster (`orchestrating-executors`).

**A run ends on exactly one of these**, always with the pointer written first and
one outbox entry:

| Ends because | Outbox entry |
|--------------|--------------|
| Milestone done | `sẵn sàng tích hợp` + `<repo>@<sha>` per repo + test counts |
| A decision it may not make | The question, the options, what it recommends |
| Blocked, or needs commons or another lane | Escalation with evidence |
| Waiting on executor jobs | `chờ job: <ids>` |
| Time for a reset | `reset: <lý do>` |

Guessing past a question to keep the run going is the failure this table exists to
prevent: the answer lands in code before the user ever sees the question.

Before exiting, the run checks its pointer against one test: **could an empty
session, given only the charter, this pointer and the inbox, start *Việc kế tiếp*
immediately?** If not, the pointer is not done.

## When to Reset

A long session degrades: early detail crowds out the current task. A lane run
should end at a clean point and let the next one start from the pointer — but only
when the pointer can carry everything that matters. Reset needs **both**:

**1. The session is long** — any of:
- It has accepted about as many tasks as the agreement's lane-run limit.
- Its context has grown past the threshold the Chief watches — the agreement's
  number, or **about 300k tokens** when it sets none (a proposed `~` value until
  the user confirms one).
- It was compacted. Strongest signal: reset at the next clean point.

**2. What remains is clear and converging:**
- *Việc kế tiếp* is concrete and startable.
- No investigation half-done, no hypotheses held only in context.
- No executor running that the pointer does not list.

Long but still diverging — mid-debugging with three live hypotheses — keeps going
until it converges. If it must stop anyway, the hypotheses and their evidence go
into *Cảnh báo đang mở* first.

**A clean point:** the last task accepted and committed, every running job
recorded, the pointer written with evidence, `reset` in the outbox.

**Who triggers it:** the lane itself when it sees both conditions; or the Chief,
which can see the run's context size from its output and writes `tìm điểm dừng` to
the inbox. The lane stops at its next checkpoint, not mid-task.

**The hard ceiling** (turn limit or timeout on the launch) is a safety net, not the
plan. Hitting it is a dirty stop — the next run must reconcile before trusting the
pointer. Repeated dirty stops mean the lane-run limit is too high: lower it.

## The Chief's Loop

The Chief launches each lane run in the background with a monitor attached, as
`orchestrating-executors` requires for any dispatch, and watches three things:

- **The run's exit** → read the new outbox entries and act.
- **The run's context size** → past the threshold, write `tìm điểm dừng`.
- **Job exit files a lane is waiting on** → when all have landed, start a new run.

Outbox handling:

| Entry | Chief does |
|-------|------------|
| Ready @sha | Integrate (below), then the next milestone in the inbox — or close the lane |
| Question | Answer from settled rules if it can; otherwise ask the user, batched with other lanes' questions; write the answer to the inbox; start a new run |
| Escalation | Resolve: amend commons or a contract, re-split lanes, or ask the user |
| Lesson proposal | Record it in the ledger (`lessons-ledger`) |
| Reset / waiting | Start a new run when there is something to do |

When the Chief changes anything shared, it writes one inbox line to every lane
affected, naming what changed (and the SHA, where it is versioned). Lanes read shared
documents straight from the project root, so **a saved edit is already published**:
the Chief edits a shared document only when the change is ready.

## Integration

The Chief does not re-review a lane's tasks — the lane accepted each one with
`checkpoint-verification`. The Chief checks what no lane can see:

1. Merge each lane branch at the reported SHA into that repo's `main`.
2. Run the contract tests and the cross-service paths end to end — drive the real
   runtime path across the services (`checkpoint-verification`), not just each
   side's own tests.
3. Adversarial review at integration altitude (`adversarial-review-to-go`): how the
   services meet, not how each is written.

Lanes that ship on the same milestone are merged one at a time, each verified
before the next.

## The Chief's Own Session

The Chief is interactive, so it does not reset itself — it follows *Suggesting a
Fresh Session* in `pointer-handoff`, like any single coordinator. The same two
conditions apply, with the same threshold: when they hold, it writes its pointer and **suggests** a new session to the
user. Its pointer stays short by holding the lane board, not the lanes' detail.

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Resume the lane's last session, it already knows everything" | That is the context the reset exists to shed. New session, from the pointer. |
| "The lane can wait for its executor in the background" | Headless background work dies with the session. Detach, record, stop. |
| "I'll ask the user directly, faster than going through the Chief" | Lanes never talk to the user. Stop the run and ask the Chief. |
| "Small fix in the shared lib, quicker than an escalation" | Commons belong to the Chief. The next merge from `main` will show the crossing. |
| "State dir goes in this repo's `.git`" | A workspace has several repos. State lives at the project root, next to `docs/superpowers/`. |
| "Chief should look over each lane's tasks to be safe" | The lane already verified them. The Chief verifies what crosses lanes. |
| "Session is long, reset now" while three hypotheses are open | Converge first, or write them down. A reset loses whatever the pointer doesn't hold. |
| "Two areas are small but let's make them lanes anyway" | A lane is a coordinator's worth of work. Otherwise stay single. |
| "I'll tell the lane about the contract change when it asks" | Write the inbox line when you commit the change. |
